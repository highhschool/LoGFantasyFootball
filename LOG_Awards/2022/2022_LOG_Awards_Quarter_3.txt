WEEK 12 AWARDS:
---------------------------
ANOTHER MEMBER ON THE ROSTER award - @Jewdy & @surah1599 
Just a shout out and congratulations to Jacob and Sarah who broke the news they're welcoming a baby girl. Another league member to kick the guys asses..

DRAFT DAY FUMBLE award - @EliteE  & @mstika 
They were supposed to lead this year. Both projected to finish at the top with a 13-1-0 win/loss. They now hover 5/6th but don't count 'em out yet. 

PLAYOFF CLINTCHERS award - @surah1599  & @Jewdy  & @Car 
Clinched it, need I say more? no need to worry about witching these people. Fkers made it.

PLANNING FOR NEXT YEAR award - @Grant  & @BigJed46 
They're on a 3,4 game losing streak on the back half of the season. Maybe they think throwing will land a higher draft pick... it does not.

PERPETUAL VIOLIN award - @Jewdy 
Man's on a four game winning streak but panics at the first score against him. I don't know if he's jinxing these games or makes some deal with his God... but it's workin.

THE GREAT ARIZONAN DEFENSE award - @EliteE
No Defensive touchdowns, No Recovery's, No Fumbles, No Picks, not even a single sack... This perfect storm of a defense that produced NEGATIVE 4 points. Ripping the win away from Elle and over to Jacob.
