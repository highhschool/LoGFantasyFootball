WEEK 8, LETS GET UP TO D8

We are over halfway through this season everyone! wow! who's all happy with their current position and team? Probably only about 4 of us...
Quick Reminder that the league Trade Deadline is November 19th, if there is any collusion needed to be had let this be the time.
-----------------------------------------------------
WOOOO WEEK 8 AWARDS! I'll try to make them fun but you SoB's needa be more interesting. Along with the awards I'm going to also include some Tier Lists for our current standings, I feel enough of us are in a similar spot.
(The awards this year will be given out every 4 weeks. weeks 4, 8, 12, 16)
----------------------------------------------------- 
WEEK 8 AWARDS:
---------------------------
 HAND IN THE CANDY JAR award - @Jared
This award is going to the person with the most league transactions (moves).
and well well well it's Jared with a WOMPING 30 MOVES! holy shit, you'd think he has a plan but with a score of 2-6, sitting last in the league.... they seem to be panic picks.

THE BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS award - @Grant 
Grant wins this award because he won a game I like to call "The battle of the bastards". Week 7 the two lowest scoring & standing teams HEAD TO HEAD, Grant vs Jed. In the end it was a blood bathing, both setting record high numbers, 156.44 to 178.32. Grant winning.

SWINDLING SALESMAN award - @Jared 
This man is a menace. Word on the street is Jared doesnt propose good trades? pretty... one sided trades. While we work to setup a hotline for afflicted people to call, this award should bring some awareness.

FINALLY CAUGHT A BREAK award - @BigJed46 
I'm pretty sure Jed's team is tied to his beloved Browns. He won this week by a whole .78 AND the Brownies STOMPED the Bengals. What a good week to be Jed.

OH HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN award - @mstika 
Wow, who woulda thought. Might not be getting that second Ziggy's date. Offically on the lower half of the standings, welcome to the group.

WEEK 8 CURRENT STANDINGS TIER LIST:
------------------------------------------------------------
Salad Tossers - GoodTimeGrant, RIPBreeceHall, Ekeler'sEdge, BulletproofBrian
These teams will toss ur salad every week, no problem. 
Dead Men Walking - Ziggy's1stDateWinner, ClevelandOrDie, RIPChase, EliteE
These people put up decent points per week but they need wins if they'll want to make it to the playoffs.
Cannon Fodder - BestFriendsForever, Goobers
We have the lowest points scored so far and the only reason I'm 6th is luck. We exist to feed the Salad Tossers.
